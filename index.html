        <p>This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and
            then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their
            children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. These "day names"
            have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. </p>
